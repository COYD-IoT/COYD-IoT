## Network Telescope Data

The evaluation was executed using 3.6 TB of darknet traffic that was collected for a 24-hour period on Dec. 13th, 2018. This data was provided by the Center for [Applied Internet Data Analysis (CAIDA) /8 network telescope](https://www.caida.org/projects/network_telescope/). While the dataset per se is subject to MOUs and thus cannot be shared as is, interested readers can request access to CAIDA's real-time darknet data through [DHS IMPACT](https://impactcybertrust.org/).
Additionally, a 24-hour sample is available at (https://tinyurl.com/y4r62eso).
